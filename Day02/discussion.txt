Coding Rules
------------

#!		- Shebang	-> give the path of python executable file

Comments - # (single line comment)

strings in python
-----------------

string can be enclosed either in 

'this is a sample text'	=> single quotes
				OR
"this is a sample text"	=>	double quotes

both the above strings are single line strings

multiple line strings are eclosed in 

	a. """    """
	b. '''	  '''


doc strings => it will give us info about a function, these doc strings are enclosed in three double quotes ot three single quotes

In python we dont use paranthesis or brackets in many places like 
	a. if conditions
	b. loops
	c. functions

instead we use indentation	=> tab key

def fun():
	this is code belongs to fun
	for i in range(1, 15):
		# for loop code
		if i % 2 == 0:
			# if condition code
			print(i)	

		
# main module code


Variables
---------
1. not declared explicitly but we do it implicitly

2. data type of the variable is decided based on the data that it holds

		i = 10			# i is an integer

		i = "hello"		# i is a string

		i = True		# i is boolean

		i = 8.9			# i is a float variable

3. data type is declared dynamically

4. variables are case sensitive in python


Control Structures
-------------------
1. if condition
2. select case (import from a library)

if conditions
--------------



2.x
---
a. raw_input	=> accept data in string
b. input		=> accept data in numbers

3.x
---
input => accepts data in string


Loops
-----
1. for loop
2. while loop


for loop => similar to foreach loop
		  => depends on a collection (list generated by range operator)

print
-----
print(data, sep=, end="\n")

for loops
---------
continue
break
else
