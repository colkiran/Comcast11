Decorator
---------
are also called as metaprogramming as they change the behaviour of another program

familiar with Functions to learn decorators and oops to implement class decorator


Closures
--------

1. function enclosed in another function

2. variable created in a different memory location is used in another memory

3. even after the loosing the scope of the variable we can still access this variable in another memory



HOF -> Higher Order Function
-----------------------------
if a function takes another function as an argument or returns a function as a return value then we 
call this function as a HOF


write a decorator that will calculate the time taken by the function to execute
